# Ecommerce Frontend Development Process Documentation

This document details the development process and key files within the `ecommerce-frontend` directory of the eCommerce project. The ecommerce frontend is a React.js application designed to provide customers with a seamless and engaging shopping experience.

## Project Setup and Initialization

Similar to the admin frontend, the `ecommerce-frontend` project was initialized using a standard React application setup. This provided the necessary build tools, development server, and a basic file structure to begin development of the customer-facing interface.

## Core Components and Their Development

### `App.js` - The Application Entry Point

`App.js` in the ecommerce frontend serves as the primary entry point, defining the overall structure and routing for the customer-facing application. Its development involved integrating `react-router-dom` for navigation and setting up global context providers to manage shared state across the application.

**Development Steps:**
1.  **Initial Setup:** `App.js` was established as the root component.
2.  **Routing Configuration:** `BrowserRouter` and `Routes` were configured to define navigation paths for various customer pages (e.g., home, product listings, cart, checkout, user profile).
3.  **Global Context Integration:** Crucially, `AuthContext`, `CartContext`, and `ProductContext` providers were wrapped around the application to make authentication status, shopping cart data, and product information globally accessible to relevant components. This was a key step in managing application state efficiently.
4.  **Layout Definition:** The main layout, including the navigation bar (`Navbar.js`) and footer (`Footer.js`), was structured within or around `App.js`.

### `context/AuthContext.js`, `context/CartContext.js`, `context/ProductContext.js` - Global State Management

These context files were developed to centralize and manage critical application state, avoiding prop-drilling and simplifying component interactions. They provide data and functions to components that need to access or modify shared information.

**Development Steps:**
1.  **Context Creation:** Each context (`AuthContext`, `CartContext`, `ProductContext`) was created using `React.createContext()`.
2.  **Provider Implementation:** Corresponding provider components were developed to hold the state and provide it to their children. These providers often manage their own internal state using `useState` and `useReducer` hooks.
3.  **Authentication Logic (`AuthContext.js`):** Functions for user login, registration, and logout were implemented within the `AuthContext` provider. This involved making API calls to the backend, storing/removing JWT tokens, and updating the authentication state.
4.  **Cart Logic (`CartContext.js`):** Functions for adding items to the cart, removing items, updating quantities, and calculating cart totals were developed. This context often interacts with local storage to persist cart data across sessions.
5.  **Product Data Management (`ProductContext.js`):** Logic for fetching product lists, applying filters, and managing product-related state was implemented. This context would typically make API calls to the backend to retrieve product information.

### `pages/Home.js` - The Storefront Entry Point

`Home.js` was developed as the main landing page for customers, designed to be visually appealing and to highlight key aspects of the store.

**Development Steps:**
1.  **Content Layout:** Sections for featured products, new arrivals, and category showcases were designed.
2.  **Data Display:** Components were integrated to display product information fetched from the `ProductContext` or directly via API calls.
3.  **Navigation:** Links to product categories and individual product detail pages were prominently placed.

### `pages/Products.js` - Product Listing and Filtering

This component was developed to allow users to browse and discover products. It includes functionalities for displaying products, filtering, and sorting.

**Development Steps:**
1.  **Product Fetching:** Logic to fetch products from the backend API, potentially with query parameters for filtering and sorting.
2.  **Display Layout:** Products were rendered in a grid or list format using reusable product card components.
3.  **Filtering and Sorting UI:** User interface elements (e.g., dropdowns, checkboxes) were implemented to allow users to filter by category, price range, or sort by relevance, price, etc.
4.  **Pagination:** Pagination controls were added to handle large numbers of products efficiently.

### `pages/ProductDetails.js` - In-depth Product Information

`ProductDetails.js` provides a comprehensive view of a single product, allowing customers to make informed purchasing decisions.

**Development Steps:**
1.  **Data Retrieval:** The component fetches detailed information for a specific product using its ID from the URL parameter.
2.  **Image Gallery:** An image gallery or carousel was implemented to display multiple product images.
3.  **Add to Cart/Wishlist:** Functionality to add the product to the shopping cart or wishlist was integrated, interacting with `CartContext` and potentially `WishlistContext`.
4.  **Review Display and Submission:** Existing customer reviews were displayed, and a form was provided for authenticated users to submit new reviews.

### `pages/Cart.js` - Shopping Cart Management

`Cart.js` was developed to provide a clear overview of the items in the user's shopping cart and to facilitate the checkout process.

**Development Steps:**
1.  **Cart Item Display:** Each item in the cart was displayed with its image, name, price, and quantity.
2.  **Quantity Adjustment:** Controls were added to allow users to increase or decrease the quantity of each item.
3.  **Item Removal:** Functionality to remove items from the cart was implemented.
4.  **Total Calculation:** The subtotal and total amount were dynamically calculated and displayed.
5.  **Checkout Link:** A prominent button or link was provided to proceed to the checkout page.

### `pages/Checkout.js` - The Purchase Funnel

`Checkout.js` guides the user through the multi-step process of completing a purchase, including shipping details and payment.

**Development Steps:**
1.  **Multi-step Form:** A multi-step form was designed to collect shipping address, billing information, and payment details.
2.  **Stripe Integration:** The `@stripe/stripe-js` library was integrated to securely collect payment information. This involved creating `Elements` and `CardElement` components for PCI compliance.
3.  **Order Confirmation:** Logic to send the order details and payment intent to the backend for processing was implemented.
4.  **Validation:** Client-side validation was added to ensure all required fields are filled correctly.

### `pages/Login.js` and `pages/Signup.js` - User Authentication

These pages handle the user registration and login processes for customers.

**Development Steps:**
1.  **Form Design:** User-friendly forms for email/username and password were created.
2.  **API Interaction:** Axios was used to send user credentials to the backend authentication endpoints.
3.  **State Update:** Upon successful login/signup, the `AuthContext` was updated with user information and the JWT.
4.  **Redirection:** Users were redirected to the home page or their profile page after successful authentication.

### `pages/Profile.js` - User Account Management

`Profile.js` allows authenticated users to view and update their personal information and manage their account settings.

**Development Steps:**
1.  **Data Display:** User details (name, email, address) were fetched and displayed.
2.  **Update Forms:** Forms were provided to allow users to edit their personal information, including adding/editing shipping addresses.
3.  **Password Change:** A secure form for changing the user's password was implemented.

### `pages/Orders.js` and `pages/OrderDetails.js` - Order History

These components provide users with access to their past orders and detailed information about each purchase.

**Development Steps:**
1.  **Order List (`Orders.js`):** Fetched and displayed a list of all orders placed by the logged-in user, showing key summaries.
2.  **Detailed View (`OrderDetails.js`):** When an order was selected, this component fetched and displayed comprehensive details, including all purchased items, quantities, prices, shipping information, and order status.

### `pages/Wishlist..js` (Likely `Wishlist.js`) - Saved Products

This component allows users to manage a list of products they are interested in.

**Development Steps:**
1.  **Wishlist Display:** Products added to the wishlist were fetched and displayed.
2.  **Actions:** Functionality to remove items from the wishlist or move them to the shopping cart was implemented.

## Utility and Styling Files
